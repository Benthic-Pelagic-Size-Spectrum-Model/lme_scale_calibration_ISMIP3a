# lme_scale_calibration_ISMIP3a

STEPS:

Step 1. LME-scale calibration:
"runLMEcalibration.RDS"
-this code estimates fihsing mortality paramters ( catchability and selectivities for each functional group)
- need to check and adjust search volume parameter

Step 2. For each LME run model with and without fishing
